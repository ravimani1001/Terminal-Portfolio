# 🖥️ Terminal Portfolio - Ravi Mani

A responsive, terminal-style portfolio website built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Inspired by real command-line terminals, this portfolio supports commands like `about`, `projects`, `contact`, `help`, and even easter egg commands like `sudo`, `whoareyou`, and `rocknroll`.  
Everything is interactive and we can use arrow keys for command history navigation as in real terminal.
